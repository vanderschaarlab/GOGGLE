### Abstract

Generative modelling of tabular data entails a particular set of challenges, including heterogeneous relationships, limited number of samples, and difficulties in incorporating prior knowledge. This work introduces **GOGGLE**, a generative model that learns a relational structure underlying tabular data to better model variable dependencies, to introduce regularization, and to incorporate prior knowledge.

![GOGGLE Overview](./figures/goggle_recipe.png?raw=True)
**Key components of GOGGLE Framework.** 1. Simultaneous learning of relational structure $G_\phi$ and $F_\theta$ s.t. generative process respects relational structure. 2. Injection of prior knowledge and regularization on variable dependence. 3. Synthetic sample generated using $\hat{x} = F_\theta(z; G_\phi) \:, \: z\sim p_Z$.

### Experiments

To setup the virtual environment and necessary packages, please run the following commands:
```
$ conda create --name goggle_env python=3.8
$ conda activate goggle_env
```
Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tennisonliu/goggle.git
$ cd goggle
```
Install the required modules:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Place dataset in ```exps/data```, and see experiment notebooks with instructions in:
 - 1) ```exps/synthetic_data.``` for synthetic data generation
 - 2) ```exps/prior_knowledge/.``` for incorporating prior knowledge, and
 - 3) ```exps/ablation/.``` for ablation settings.
